# Action Panel

The Action Panel is designed for further operations on the query results. A search result can have multiple actions. However, only one action can be set as the default action. When
a user selects a search result, the Action Panel can be invoked with the shortcut `Cmd/Alt + J`. If the user presses `Enter` on the selected search result without invoking the
Action Panel, the default action will be executed.

## How to use the Action Panel

1. First, enter your search criteria, and the system will display the search results.
2. Use the up and down arrow keys to select the search result you want to operate on.
3. Press the `Cmd/Alt + J` shortcut to invoke the Action Panel.
4. In the Action Panel, you can see all available actions for the currently selected search result.
5. Use the up and down arrow keys to select the action you want to execute, and then press the `Enter` key to execute.

Please note that different search results may have different available actions. For example, file type search results may have open, copy path, delete, etc., while application type
search results may have open, uninstall, etc.

## Default Action

Each search result can have one default action. This is the action that will be executed when the user presses `Enter` on the selected search result without invoking the Action
Panel. The default action can be set in the settings of each search result.
