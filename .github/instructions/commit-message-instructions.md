Follow the Conventional Commits format strictly for commit messages. Use the structure below:

```
<type>[scope]: <description>

[optional body]
```

Guidelines:
- **Language**: Use english
- **Type and Scope**: Choose an appropriate type (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`) and scope to describe the affected module or feature (e.g., `ui`, `ai`, `windows`, `macos`) .
- **Description**: Write a concise, informative description in the header; use backticks if referencing code or specific terms.
- **Body**: For additional details, use a well-structured body section:
  - Use bullet points (`*`) for clarity.
  - Clearly describe the motivation, context, or technical details behind the change, if applicable.
  - Commit messages should be clear, informative, and professional, aiding readability and project tracking.
