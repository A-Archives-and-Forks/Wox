# Wox Project General Coding Standards

## General Guidelines

* Avoid redundant comments, add necessary explanations only for complex logic
* Variables, functions, and class names should be descriptive, clearly expressing their purpose
* Keep code concise, avoid unnecessary complexity

## Naming Conventions

* **Go code**: Use camelCase, e.g., `pluginManager`, public methods start with an uppercase letter
* **Python code**: Use snake_case, e.g., `plugin_manager`, class names use CamelCase with the first letter capitalized
* **Dart code**: Use camelCase, class names start with an uppercase letter
* **File names**: Use lowercase letters and underscores, e.g., `plugin_manager.py`

## Error Handling

* All potential error locations must have appropriate error handling
* Error messages should be clear and understandable, helping to understand the problem
* Avoid swallowing exceptions, ensure errors are properly logged or handled

## Version Control

* Run relevant tests before committing to ensure code works properly
* Commit messages should clearly express the content of changes
* Each commit should focus on a single feature or fix
* Follow the project's branch management strategy

## Internationalization

* All user-facing text should support internationalization
* Use the project's provided internationalization tools, don't hardcode text
* Test appearance in different language environments
